The project was started by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga.  After working in healthcare data science for more than a decade they became frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress in the field.  From their standpoint, they saw every healthcare data engineer and data scientist solving the same problems over and over again with almost zero improvement in terms of data empowering better treatment and care delivery decisions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
